## TPPI Resources Explained

### Producer Side (Security Service Provider)

#### 1. Intercept Deployment Group
- **Purpose**: Logical container for security service deployments
- **Scope**: Project-level, Global
- **Function**: Groups all zonal deployments and provides external visibility to consumers

#### 2. Intercept Deployment
- **Purpose**: Specific zonal deployment of security appliances
- **Scope**: Project-level, Zonal
- **Function**: Links ILB frontend to deployment group, enables PSC attachment

### Consumer Side (Traffic Owner)

#### 3. Intercept Endpoint Group
- **Purpose**: Virtual representation of producer's security service
- **Scope**: Organization-level, Global
- **Function**: Abstracts access to producer services, enables granular permissions

#### 4. Intercept Endpoint Group Association
- **Purpose**: Links VPC networks to endpoint groups
- **Scope**: Project-level, Global
- **Function**: Enables PSC endpoint creation in consumer VPCs

### Security Configuration

#### 5. Security Profile (CustomIntercept)
- **Purpose**: Policy configuration for intercepted traffic
- **Scope**: Organization-level
- **Function**: References endpoint group for traffic redirection

#### 6. Security Profile Group
- **Purpose**: Groups security profiles for firewall rule application
- **Scope**: Organization-level
- **Function**: Applied to firewall rules with `apply_security_profile_group` action

## Key Educational Features

### 1. Concept Explanations
- **VPC Networks**: "Think of a VPC network like your own private section of the internet in the cloud"
- **Subnets**: "Regional networks within your VPC that define IP address ranges"
- **TPPI**: "Transparent redirection of network traffic to security appliances for inspection"

### 2. Visual Learning Aids
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Step-by-step workflow visualization
- **Role Cards**: Clear differentiation between producer and consumer roles
- **Progress Indicators**: Step completion tracking in wizards

### 3. Guided Workflows
- **Smart Defaults**: Recommended configurations for beginners
- **Validation**: Real-time form validation with helpful error messages
- **Tooltips**: Contextual help throughout the interface

### 4. Best Practices Integration
- **Security First**: Emphasis on secure configurations
- **Cost Awareness**: Cost estimation and free tier information
- **Performance**: Zone selection guidance for optimal performance
