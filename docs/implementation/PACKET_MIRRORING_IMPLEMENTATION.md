## Packet Mirroring Resources Explained

### Provider Side (Monitoring Service Provider)

#### 1. Mirror Deployment Group
- **Purpose**: Logical container for monitoring service deployments
- **Scope**: Project-level, Global
- **Function**: Groups all zonal deployments and provides external visibility to consumers

#### 2. Mirror Deployment
- **Purpose**: Specific zonal deployment of monitoring tools
- **Scope**: Project-level, Zonal
- **Function**: Links ILB frontend to deployment group, enables PSC attachment for traffic mirroring

### Consumer Side (Traffic Owner)

#### 3. Mirror Endpoint Group
- **Purpose**: Virtual representation of provider's monitoring service
- **Scope**: Organization-level, Global
- **Function**: Abstracts access to provider services, enables granular permissions

#### 4. Mirror Endpoint Group Association
- **Purpose**: Links VPC networks to endpoint groups
- **Scope**: Project-level, Global
- **Function**: Enables PSC endpoint creation in consumer VPCs for traffic copying

### Mirror Configuration

#### 5. Mirror Security Profile (CustomMirror)
- **Purpose**: Policy configuration for mirrored traffic
- **Scope**: Organization-level
- **Function**: References endpoint group for traffic mirroring

#### 6. Mirror Security Profile Group
- **Purpose**: Groups mirror profiles for firewall rule application
- **Scope**: Organization-level
- **Function**: Applied to firewall rules with mirror action for traffic copying

## Key Differences from TPPI

### Functional Differences
- **TPPI**: Intercepts and redirects traffic for security inspection
- **Packet Mirroring**: Copies traffic for monitoring and analysis without affecting original flow

### Resource Naming
- **TPPI**: InterceptDeploymentGroup, InterceptEndpointGroup, CustomIntercept profiles
- **Packet Mirroring**: MirrorDeploymentGroup, MirrorEndpointGroup, CustomMirror profiles

### Use Cases
- **TPPI**: Security enforcement, threat prevention, compliance
- **Packet Mirroring**: Network monitoring, performance analysis, troubleshooting, security monitoring

### Impact on Traffic
- **TPPI**: Can affect traffic flow (latency, blocking)
- **Packet Mirroring**: Zero impact on original traffic flow

## Key Educational Features

### 1. Concept Explanations
- **Monitoring Provider**: "Organizations that provide network monitoring and analysis services"
- **Traffic Owner**: "Organizations that want their traffic mirrored for analysis"
